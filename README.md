# In this reporitory I explore the process of creating a model to perform a image classification
## The dataset can be download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)
## And [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/enricopiffer/cats-dogs-classification) the link to the Kaggle notebook
## In the notebook I detailded all the process and as result we can see that with data augmentation the accuracy on the test set increases from 88% to 91% with the same model achitecture. I tried different achitectures but maybe with another one it would make the data augmentation useless on this data. Data augmentation anyway is a good practice to be able to work with small datasets and also to generalize even better.
